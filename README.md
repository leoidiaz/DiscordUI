# Discord UI
## Re-creating the UI of the Discord iOS App

* UIKit 
* Programmatic UI

The purpose of this app is to practice using a Programmatic UI instead of Storyboards by recreating the Discord app's user interface. 

I wrote an article highlighting the process of this app in depth and can be found here: [Medium](https://medium.com/@leonardoidiaz/programmatic-ui-discord-de1e59b3c2be)
